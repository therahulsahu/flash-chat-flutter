# flash-chat-flutter
A Chat application build using flutter and firebase.

The objective of this Project is to learn how to incorporate Firebase into Flutter apps. We'll be using Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip our app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods.
